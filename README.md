```
npm i -s segfault-raub
```

This module installs platform-specific **signal** listeners
(see `sigaction` for **Unix** and `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` for **Windows**).
Whenever a signal is raised, the module prints a native stack trace (if possible) to both
**STDERR** and to the "**segfault.log**" file (if it exists). If there is no such file, it
**won't be created**, so it is up to you if the log-file is needed.

> Note: this **addon uses N-API**, and therefore is ABI-compatible across different
Node.js versions. Addon binaries are precompiled and **there is no compilation**
step during the `npm i` command.

A zero-setup is available: just require the module and it comes pre-equipped with several
signal listeners enabled by default.

```javascript
require('segfault-raub');
```

> Note: if your project tree contains multiple versions of this module, the first one imported
will seize `global['segfault-raub']`. The rest of them will only re-export `global['segfault-raub']`
and **WILL NOT** import their own **binaries**.


## Enabling Signals

As listed below, some signals (platform specific) are enabled by default. But they can be
enabled/disabled manually:

Example:

```javascript
const {
    setSignal,
    EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION, SIGSEGV,
    EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT, SIGTRAP,
} = require('segfault-raub');

setSignal(EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION, false);
setSignal(SIGSEGV, false);

setSignal(EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT, true);
setSignal(SIGTRAP, true);
```

On **Windows**, all the **Unix** signals are `null`, and the opposite is true.
Passing `null` as the first parameter to `setSignal` **has no effect and is safe**.


## Demo Methods

These are be helpful to see how the signals are reported and if the log files are being written properly.

* `causeSegfault` - Causes a memory access violation.
* `causeDivisionInt` - Divides an integer by zero.
* `causeOverflow` - Runs infinite recursion (stack overflow).
* `causeIllegal` - Raises an "illegal instruction" exception.

Example:

```javascript
const { causeSegfault } = require('segfault-raub');
causeSegfault();
```
