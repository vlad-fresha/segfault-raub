# Segfault handler for Node.js

This is a part of [Node3D](https://github.com/node-3d) project.

```
npm i -s segfault-raub
```

This module installs platform-specific **signal** listeners
(see `sigaction` for **Unix** and `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` for **Windows**).
Whenever a signal is raised, the module prints a native stack trace (if possible) to both
**STDERR** and to the "**segfault.log**" file (if it exists). If there is no such file, it
**won't be created**, so it is up to you if the log-file is needed.

> Note: this **addon uses N-API**, and therefore is ABI-compatible across different
Node.js versions. Addon binaries are precompiled and **there is no compilation**
step during the `npm i` command.

A zero-setup is available: just require the module and it comes pre-equipped with several
signal listeners enabled by default.

```javascript
require('segfault-raub');
```

## Output Formats

The module supports both plain text and JSON output formats. By default, it uses plain text format. You can switch to JSON format for structured logging and easier parsing:

```javascript
const { setOutputFormat, getOutputFormat } = require('segfault-raub');

// Check current format (returns false for plain text, true for JSON)
console.log(getOutputFormat()); // false

// Enable JSON output
setOutputFormat(true);

// Disable JSON output (back to plain text)
setOutputFormat(false);
```

### JSON Output Example

When JSON output is enabled, segfaults are reported in structured format:

```json
{
  "type": "segfault",
  "signal": 11,
  "signal_name": "SIGSEGV",
  "address": "0x0",
  "pid": 12345,
  "stack": [
    {
      "address": "0x7fff8b2a1234",
      "function": "_segfaultStackFrame1()",
      "module": "/path/to/your/app"
    },
    {
      "address": "0x7fff8b2a5678",
      "function": "main",
      "module": "/path/to/your/app"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: if your project tree contains multiple versions of this module, the first one imported
will seize `global['segfault-raub']`. The rest of them will only re-export `global['segfault-raub']`
and **WILL NOT** import their own **binaries**.


## Enabling Signals

As listed below, some signals (platform specific) are enabled by default. But they can be
enabled/disabled manually:

Example:

```javascript
const {
    setSignal, setOutputFormat,
    EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION, SIGSEGV,
    EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT, SIGTRAP,
} = require('segfault-raub');

// Enable JSON output for structured error reporting
setOutputFormat(true);

setSignal(EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION, false);
setSignal(SIGSEGV, false);

setSignal(EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT, true);
setSignal(SIGTRAP, true);
```

When signals are triggered with JSON output enabled, they will be reported in structured format:

```json
{
  "type": "segfault",
  "signal": 5,
  "signal_name": "SIGTRAP",
  "address": "0x7fff8b2a1234",
  "pid": 12345,
  "stack": [
    {
      "address": "0x7fff8b2a1234",
      "function": "main",
      "module": "/path/to/your/app"
    }
  ]
}
```

On **Windows**, all the **Unix** signals are `null`, and the opposite is true.
Passing `null` as the first parameter to `setSignal` **has no effect and is safe**.


## Demo Methods

These are be helpful to see how the signals are reported and if the log files are being written properly.

* `causeSegfault` - Causes a memory access violation.
* `causeDivisionInt` - Divides an integer by zero.
* `causeOverflow` - Runs infinite recursion (stack overflow).
* `causeIllegal` - Raises an "illegal instruction" exception.

Example:

```javascript
const { causeSegfault } = require('segfault-raub');
causeSegfault();
```

### JSON Output for Demo Methods

You can also use JSON format with the demo methods for structured error reporting:

```javascript
const { causeSegfault, setOutputFormat } = require('segfault-raub');

// Enable JSON output before triggering the segfault
setOutputFormat(true);
causeSegfault(); // Will output JSON formatted error
```

This will produce structured JSON output like:

```json
{
  "type": "segfault",
  "signal": 11,
  "signal_name": "SIGSEGV",
  "address": "0x0",
  "pid": 12345,
  "stack": [
    {
      "address": "0x7fff8b2a1234",
      "function": "_segfaultStackFrame1()",
      "module": "/path/to/your/app"
    }
  ]
}
```
